## @implement directives

When instructed to implement something and you find `@implement` comments in a
file, use the instructions in the comments to implement the requested changes
and then turn the `@implement` comment blocks into documentation blocks (drop
the `@implement` and rephrase if necessary).

## Code style

- Clean up temporary files/scripts created during iteration
- Minimal comments — code explains what, comments explain why
- Output viewed in diff tools, so avoid unnecessary whitespace changes

### Ruby

- Prefer RBS signatures where the project uses them
